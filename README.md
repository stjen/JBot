# Mambutu - The Java IRC Bot

This is the github page for Mambutu, the java IRC bot.

The goal is to make an easily extendable IRC bot in Java, a lรก eggdrop, but minus the botnet part.

As of now the bot is in a very alpha state - meaning it should not be trusted to do anything useful.

I can be contacted on IRC: irc.freenode.org #peanuts, usually with the nick mabool
