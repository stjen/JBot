# JBot - The Java IRC Bot

This is the github page for JBot, the java IRC bot.

The goal is to make an easily extendable Java IRC bot, a l√° eggdrop, but minus the botnet part.

As of now the only thing it can do it stay online, and answer some basic commands. There are no scripting capabilities
or anything like that.
